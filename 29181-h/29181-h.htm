<div class="bk1"><p><i><small>Venus was the most miserable planet in the system, peopled by miserable
excuses for human beings. And somewhere among this conglomeration of
boiling protoplasm there was a being unlike the others, a being who
walked and talked like the others but who was different&mdash;and afraid
the difference would be discovered. You'll remember this short story.</small></i></p></div>

<div class="bk2"><h1><b>foundling<br />

<h2><small><i>by ... John &amp; Dorothy<br /> de Courcy</i></small></h2>

<p class="pr1"><big><b>The foundling could not have been more than three years old. Yet he
held a secret that was destined to bring joy to many unhappy people.</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Unlike Gaul</span>, the north continent
of Venus is divided into
<i>four</i> parts. No Caesar has set
foot here either, nor shall one&mdash;for
the dank, stinging, caustic air
swallows up the lives of men and
only Venus may say, <i>I conquered</i>.</p>

<p>This is colonized Venus, where
one may walk without the threat
of sudden death&mdash;except from
other men&mdash;the most bitterly
fought for, the dearest, bloodiest,
most worthless land in the solar
system.</p>

<p>Separated by men into East
and West at the center of the
Twilight Zone, the division across
the continent is the irregular,
jagged line of Mud River, springing
from the Great Serpent
Range.</p>

<p>The African Republic holds
one quarter which the Negroes
exploit as best they can, encumbered
by filter masks and
protective clothing.</p>

<p>The Asians still actually try to
colonize their quarter, while the
Venusian primitives neither help
nor hinder the bitter game of
power-politics, secret murder,
and misery&mdash;most of all, misery.</p>

<p>The men from Mars understand
this better, for their quarter
is a penal colony. Sleepy-eyed,
phlegmatic Martians, self-condemned
for minute violations
of their incredible and complex
mores&mdash;without guards save
themselves&mdash;will return to the
subterranean cities, complex philosophies,
and cool, dry air of
Mars when they have declared
their own sentences to be at an
end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they labor to extract
the wealth of Venus without
the bitterness and hate, without
the savagery and fear of their
neighbors. Hence, they are regarded
by all with the greatest
suspicion.</p>

<p>The Federated States, after
their fashion, plunder the land
and send screaming ships to
North America laden with booty
and with men grown suddenly
rich&mdash;and with men who will
never care for riches or anything
else again. These are the fortunate
dead. The rest are received
into the sloppy breast of Venus
where even a tombstone or marker
is swallowed in a few, short
weeks. And they die quickly on
Venus, and often.</p>

<p>From the arbitrary point where
the four territories met, New
Reno flung its sprawling, dirty
carcass over the muddy soil and
roared and hooted endlessly,
laughed with the rough boisterousness
of miners and spacemen,
rang with the brittle, brassy
laughter of women following a
trade older than New Reno. It
clanged and shouted and bellowed
so loudly that quiet sobbing was
never heard.</p>

<p>But a strange sound hung in
the air, the crying of a child. A
tiny child, a boy, he sat begrimed
by mud at the edge of the street
where an occasional ground car
flung fresh contamination on his
small form until he became almost
indistinguishable from the
muddy street. His whimpering
changed to prolonged wailing
sobs. He didn't turn to look at
any of the giant passers-by nor
did they even notice him.</p>

<p>But finally one passer-by
stopped. She was young and
probably from the Federated
States. She was not painted nor
was she well-dressed. She had
nothing to distinguish her, except
that she stopped.</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" she breathed, bending
over the tiny form. "You
poor thing. Where's your mama?"</p>

<p>The little figure rubbed its face,
looked at her blankly and heaved
a long, shuddering sigh.</p>

<p>"I can't leave you sitting here
in the mud!" She pulled out a
handkerchief and tried to wipe
away some of the mud and then
helped him up. His clothes were
rags, his feet bare. She took him
by the hand and as they walked
along she talked to him. But he
seemed not to hear.</p>

<p>Soon they reached the dirty,
plastic front of the Elite Cafe.
Once through the double portals,
she pulled the respirator from her
face. The air inside was dirty
and smelly but it was breathable.
People were eating noisily, boisterously,
with all the lusty, unclean
young life that was Venus.
They clamored, banged and threw
things for no reason other than
to throw them.</p>

<p>She guided the little one past
the tables filled with people and
into the kitchen. The door closed
with a bang, shutting out much
of the noise from the big room.
Gingerly she sat him down on
a stool, and with detergent and
water she began removing the
mud. His eyes were horribly
red-rimmed.</p>

<p>"It's a wonder you didn't die
out there," she murmured. "Poor
little thing!"</p>

<p>"Hey! Are you going to work
or aren't you, Jane?" a voice
boomed.</p>

<p>A large ruddy man in white
had entered the kitchen and he
stood frowning at the girl. Women
weren't rare on Venus, and
she was only a waitress ...</p>

<p>"What in the blue blazes is
that!" He pointed to the child.</p>

<p>"He was outside," the girl explained,
"sitting in the street. He
didn't have a respirator."</p>

<p>The ruddy man scowled at the
boy speculatively. "His lungs all
right?"</p>

<p>"He isn't coughing much," she
replied.</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do
with him?" the man asked Jane.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said.
"Something. Tell the Patrol
about him, I guess."</p>

<p>The beefy man hesitated. "It's
been a long time since I've seen
a kid this young on Venus. They
always ship 'em home. Could
have been dumped. Maybe his
parents left him on purpose."</p>

<p>The girl flinched.</p>

<p>He grunted disgustedly, his
face mirroring his thoughts.
<i>Stringy hair ... plain face ...
and soft as Venus slime clear
through!</i> He shrugged. "Anyway,
he's got to eat." He looked
at the small figure. "Want to eat,
kid? Would you like a glass of
milk?" He opened a refrigerator,
took out a plastic bottle and
poured milk in a glass.</p>

<p>Chubby hands reached out for
the glass.</p>

<p>"There, that's better," the cook
said. "Pete will see that you get
fed all right." He turned to the
girl. "Could he belong to someone
around here?"</p>

<p>Jane shook her head. "I don't
know. I've never seen him before."</p>

<p>"Well, he can stay in the
kitchen while you work the shift.
I'll watch him."</p>

<p>She nodded, took an apron
down from a hook and tied it
around her waist. Then she
patted the sober-faced youngster
on his tousled head and left.</p>

<p>The beefy man studied the
boy. "I think I'll put you over
there," he said. He lifted him,
stool and all, and carried him
across the kitchen. "You can
watch through that panel. See?
That's Jane in there. She'll come
back and forth, pass right by
here. Is that all right?"</p>

<p>The little one nodded.</p>

<p>"Oh?" Pete raised his eyebrows.
"So you <i>do</i> know what
I'm saying." He watched the
child for a few minutes, then
turned his attention to the range.
The rush hour was on and he
soon forgot the little boy on the
stool ...</p>

<p>Whenever possible during the
lunch-hour rush, Jane stopped to
smile and talk to the child. Once
she asked, "Don't you know
where your mama and daddy
are?"</p>

<p>He just stared at her, unblinking,
his big eyes soft and sad-looking.</p>

<p>The girl studied him for a moment,
then she picked up a cookie
and gave it to him. "Can you tell
me your name?" she asked hopefully.</p>

<p>His lips parted. Cookie crumbs
fell off his chin and from the
corners of his mouth, but he
spoke no words.</p>

<p>She sighed, turned, and went
out to the clattering throng with
laden plates of food.</p>

<p>For a while Jane was so busy
she almost forgot the young one.
But finally people began to linger
more over their food, the
clinking of dishes grew quieter
and Pete took time for a cup of
coffee. His sweating face was
haggard. He stared sullenly at
the little boy and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't be such things as
kids," he muttered. "Nothing
but a pain in the neck!"</p>

<p>Jane came through the door.
"It gets worse all the time," she
groaned. She turned to the little
boy. "Did you have something to
eat?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know what to fix for
him," Pete said. "How about
some beef stew? Do you think
he'd go for that?"</p>

<p>Jane hesitated. "I&mdash;I don't
know. Try it."</p>

<p>Pete ladled up a bowl of steaming
stew. Jane took it and put
it on the table. She took a bit
on a spoon, blew on it, then held
it out. The child opened his
mouth. She smiled and slowly
fed him the stew.</p>

<p>"How old do you think he is?"
Pete asked.</p>

<p>The girl hesitated, opened her
mouth, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"About two and a half, I'd
guess," Pete answered himself.
"Maybe three." Jane nodded and
he turned back to cleaning the
stove.</p>

<p>"Don't you want some more
stew?" Jane asked as she offered
the small one another spoonful.</p>

<p>The little mouth didn't open.</p>

<p>"Guess you've had enough,"
she said, smiling.</p>

<p>Pete glanced up. "Why don't
you leave now, Jane. You're
going to have to see the Patrol
about that kid. I can take care
of things here."</p>

<p>She stood thinking for a moment.
"Can I use an extra respirator?"</p>

<p>"You can't take him out
without one!" Pete replied. He
opened a locker and pulled out
a transparent facepiece. "I think
this'll tighten down enough to fit
his face."</p>

<p>She took it and walked over
to the youngster. His large eyes
had followed all her movements
and he drew back slightly as she
held out the respirator. "It won't
hurt," she coaxed. "You have to
wear it. The air outside stings."</p>

<p>The little face remained steady
but the eyes were fearful as Jane
slid the transparent mask over
his head and tightened the elastic.
It pulsed slightly with his breathing.</p>

<p>"Better wrap him in this," Pete
suggested, pulling a duroplast
jacket out of the locker. "Air's
tough on skin."</p>

<p>The girl nodded, pulling on
her own respirator. She stepped
quickly into her duroplast suit
and tied it. "Thanks a lot, Pete,"
she said, her voice slightly muffled.
"See you tomorrow."</p>

<p>Pete grunted as he watched
her wrap the tiny form in the
jacket, lift it gently in her arms,
then push through the door.</p>

<p>The girl walked swiftly up the
street. It was quieter now, but
in a short time the noise and
stench and garishness of New
Reno would begin rising to
another cacophonous climax.</p>

<p>The strange pair reached a
wretched metal structure with an
askew sign reading, "El Grande
Hotel." Jane hurried through the
double portals, the swish of air
flapping her outer garments as
the air conditioning unit fought
savagely to keep out the rival atmosphere
of the planet.</p>

<p>There was no one at the desk
and no one in the lobby. It was
a forlorn place, musty and
damp. Venus humidity seemed to
eat through everything, even
metal, leaving it limp, faded, and
stinking.</p>

<p>She hesitated, looked at the
visiphone, then impulsively pulled
a chair over out of the line of
sight of the viewing plate and
gently set the little boy on it.
She pulled the respirator from
her face, pressed the button under
the blank visiphone disk. The
plate lit up and hummed faintly.</p>

<p>"Patrol Office," Jane said.</p>

<p>There was a click and a middle-aged,
square-faced man with
blue-coated shoulders appeared.
"Patrol Office," he repeated.</p>

<p>"This is Jane Grant. I work
at the Elite Cafe. Has anyone
lost a little boy?"</p>

<p>The patrolman's eyebrows
raised slightly. "Little boy? Did
you find one?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I&mdash;I saw one earlier
this evening," she faltered. "He
was sitting at the edge of the
street and I took him into the
cafe and fed him."</p>

<p>"Well, there aren't many children
in town," he replied. "Let's
see." He glanced at a record
sheet. "No, none's reported missing.
He with you now?"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;no."</p>

<p>He shook his head again, still
looking downward. He said slowly,
"His parents must have found
him. If he was wandering we'd
have picked him up. There is a
family that live around there who
have a ten-year-old kid who wanders
off once in a while. Blond,
stutters a little. Was it him?"</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;" she began. She
paused, said firmly, "No."</p>

<p>"Well, we don't have any reports
on lost children. Haven't
had for some time. If the boy
was lost his parents must have
found him. Thank you for calling."
He broke the connection.</p>

<p>Jane stood staring at the blank
plate. No one had reported a
little boy missing. In all the
maddening confusion that was
New Reno, no one had missed a
little boy.</p>

<p>She looked at the small bundle,
walked over and slipped off
his respirator. "I should have
told the truth," she murmured to
him softly. "But you're so tiny
and helpless. Poor little thing!"</p>

<p>He looked up at her, then
around the lobby, his brown eyes
resting on first one object, then
another. His little chin began
to quiver.</p>

<p>The girl picked him up and
stroked his hair. "Don't cry,"
she soothed. "Everything's going
to be all right."</p>

<p>She walked down a hall, fumbling
inside her coveralls for a
key. At the end of the hall she
stopped, unlocked a door, and
carried him inside. As an afterthought
she locked the door, still
holding the small bundle in her
arms. Then she placed him on a
bed, removed the jacket and
threw it on a chair.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I should
go to all this trouble," she said,
removing her protective coveralls.
"I'll probably get picked up by
the Patrol. But <i>somebody's</i> got
to look after you."</p>

<p>She sat down beside him.
"Aren't you even a bit sleepy?"</p>

<p>He smiled a little.</p>

<p>"Maybe now you can tell me
your name," she said. "Don't
you know your name?"</p>

<p>His expression didn't change.</p>

<p>She pointed to herself. "Jane."
Then she hesitated, looked downward
for a moment. "Jana, I
was called before I came here."</p>

<p>The little face looked up at
her. The small mouth opened.
"Jana." It was half whisper, half
whistle.</p>

<p>"That's right," she replied,
stroking his hair. "My, but your
throat must be sore. I hope you
won't be sick from breathing too
much of that awful air."</p>

<p>She regarded him quizzically.
"You know, I've never seen many
little boys. I don't quite know
how to treat one. But I know
you should get some sleep."</p>

<p>She smiled and reached over
to take off the rags. He pulled
away suddenly.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," she said
reassuringly. "I wouldn't hurt
you."</p>

<p>He clutched the little ragged
shirt tightly.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," she repeated
soothingly. "I'll tell you
what. You lie down and I'll put
this blanket over you," she said,
rising. "Will that be all right?"</p>

<p>She laid him down and covered
the small form with a
blanket. He lay there watching
her with his large eyes.</p>

<p>"You don't look very sleepy,"
she said. "Perhaps I had better
turn the light down." She did
so, slowly, so as not to alarm
him. But he was silent, watchful,
never taking his eyes from
her.</p>

<p>She smiled and sat down next
to him. "Now I'll tell you a story
and then you must go to sleep,"
she said softly.</p>

<p>He smiled&mdash;just a little smile&mdash;and
she was pleased.</p>

<p>"Fine," she cried. "Well&mdash;once
upon a time there was a
beautiful planet, not at all like
this one. There were lovely
flowers and cool-running streams
and it only rained once in a while.
You'd like it there for it's a very
nice place. But there were people
there who liked to travel&mdash;to
see strange places and new things,
and one day they left in a great
big ship."</p>

<p>She paused again, frowning in
thought. "Well, they traveled
a long, long way and saw many
things. Then one day something
went wrong."</p>

<p>Her voice was low and soft.
It had the quality of a dream,
the texture of a zephyr, but the
little boy was still wide awake.</p>

<p>"Something went very, very
wrong and they tried to land so
they could fix it. But when they
tried to land they found they
couldn't&mdash;and they fell and just
barely managed to save themselves.
The big, beautiful ship
was all broken. Well, since they
couldn't fix the ship at all now,
they set out on foot to find out
where they were and to see if
they could get help. Then they
found that they were in a land
of great big giants, and the
people were very fierce."</p>

<p>The little boy's dark eyes were
watching her intently but she
went on, hardly noticing.</p>

<p>"So they went back to the
broken ship and tried to decide
what to do. They couldn't get
in touch with their home because
the radio part of the ship
was all broken up. And the
giants were horrible and wanted
everything for themselves and
were cruel and mean and probably
would have hurt the poor
ship-wrecked people if they had
known they were there.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;do you know what they
did? They got some things from
the ship and they went and built
a giant. And they put little motors
inside and things to make it
run and talk so that the giants
wouldn't be able to tell that it
wasn't another giant just like
themselves."</p>

<p>She paused, straightening
slightly.</p>

<p>"And then they made a space
inside the giant where somebody
could sit and run this big giant
and talk and move around&mdash;and
the giants wouldn't ever know
that she was there. They made
it a <i>she</i>. In fact, she was the
only person who could do it because
she could learn to talk all
sorts of languages&mdash;that's what
she could do best. So she went out
in the giant suit and mingled with
the giants and worked just like
they did.</p>

<p>"But every once in a while
she'd go back to the others,
bringing them things they needed.
And she would bring back news.
That was their only hope&mdash;news
of a ship which might be looking
for them, which might take
them home&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off. "I wonder what
the end of the story will be?"
she murmured.</p>

<p>For some time she had not
been using English. She had been
speaking in a soft, fluid language
unlike anything ever heard on
Venus. But now she had stopped
speaking entirely.</p>

<p>After a slight pause&mdash;another
voice spoke&mdash;in the same melodious,
alien tongue! It said, "I
think I know the end of the story.
I think someone has come for
you poor people and is going to
take you home."</p>

<p>She gasped&mdash;for she realized
it had not been her voice. Her
artificial eyes watched, stunned,
as the little boy began peeling
off a skin-tight, flexible baby-faced
mask, revealing underneath
the face of a little man.</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
